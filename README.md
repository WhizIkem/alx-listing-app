# 🏠 ALX Listing App

## 📌 Project Description

The **ALX Listing App** is a simplified Airbnb clone built as part of the ALX Frontend Development Program. Its goal is to replicate the core listing features of Airbnb—specifically the ability to view property listings, detailed views of each listing, and a clean, responsive UI that works across devices.

This project gives us the opportunity to practice real-world frontend skills including component-based architecture, routing, state management, and responsive UI/UX design using modern tools like **React**, **TypeScript**, and **TailwindCSS**.
